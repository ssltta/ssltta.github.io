* Breaking Fortigate
** Introduction
I find reverse engineering super cool, I read a thousand ctf/bug bounty blogposts, I did one easy ctf, I think I am ready to find a bug in a security sensitive device!

Cue in 2 months later...

Fortinet makes Internet facing devices, Internet facing devices are interesting for reverse engineers because if a hacker finds a 0day for that device, they'll have a foothold in your network in a manner no one can prevent.

** How am I doing this?
The way I imagine this will go is I will get my hands on the firmware, and then I will be able to extract the binaries that are listening on the internet for traffic, in the hopes of analyzing it and finding a cool vulnerability.
To recap: we get the firmware -> we extract the binaries -> we analyze the binaries -> we find a 0day

** Getting the firmware image 
You can find the images on the vendor's website or scattered accross the internet, I am currently analyzing fortigate 7.4.6 KVM

Now you should have a file called fortios.qcow2, you'll probably notice that this image as-is is not useful, what is a qcow2 file anyway?

From wikipedia: "qcow is a file format for disk image files used by QEMU, a hosted virtual machine monitor."

Okay, so after following this [[https://gist.github.com/shamil/62935d9b456a6f9877b5][github gist]], we get [[../static/fortigate_file_content.png]]

Yours probably won't look the same, because i added a bunch of files

Cool, so after scouring every directory I notice that there's no trace of binaries here, is this the wrong image? Did I do something wrong?

Does this even work? I boot up the image and check, and it does, so what's up with that? How does this start? What's the entryway for a Linux system to start? Maybe the grub config will tell me something [[../static/fortigate_grub.png]]

flatkc is the linux kernel image that gets loaded, rootfs.gz is the ramdisk, the virtual machine has an empty hdd slot so i assume this is where all of the binaries reside, let's gunzip it!

Okay, not a gzip file, what is it then?

```

it doesn't look like anything, this must mean that rootfs.gz is an encrypted file, flatkc must have some encryption functions that grab this rootfs.gz file and then decrypts it, we just need to slap flatkc in ghidra and look for it, right? Is this even possible for someone who hasn't touched a line of assembly since high school?

** Reverse engineering the kernel image
I realize that to figure out how to decrypt the rootfs.gz file, I must first learn how the file is encrypted, so I try to load up the kernel image file for the router (here on after i'll simply call it 'flatkc', which is the name of the kernel image file)
in Ghidra, but it doesn't work, Ghidra cannot load this type of file
[[../static/fortigate_ghidra_supported_formats.png]]

``file`` says that ``flatkc`` is a ``linux kernel boot executable image``, which is not one of the file types listed, fortunately there's this great [[https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf][tool]] that converts linux boot images into elf, built exactly for this purpose, we can now import it on Ghidra and start looking at it.

I look for functions related with startup and initramfs unpacking, I find a function called ``populate_rootfs`` which has the initrd address on it, which i quickly make a note of, and yes, the image came with symbols, but seemingly only the linux ones and some timer management stuff for some fortigate service we aren't concerned with.

[[../static/fortigate_populate_root_fs.png]]

the address of ``__initramfs_start`` gets mentioned here by a bunch of functions, including an unlabeled one which i labelled myself, proc_crypto_keys (the function does a lot more than this, but you'll see this later), out of all the functions mentioned, this one seems the most interesting! Let's look at it

*** Breakdown of the function

The decompiled version of the proc_crypto_keys function is very long, and despite the name that i gave it, it does not just process crypto keys (in retrospective, it is a pretty nonsensical name)

I wrote a bunch explaining each and every single line of the decompiled code, but that wasn't very good reading so i'll just give you the high level overview of the code except for the interesting part
- It does a bunch of memory hygiene operations like zeroing buffers and initializing variables
- It verifies that the image matches a RSA BER-encoded key 
- starts and updates a few SHA buffers
- it encrypts/decrypts something with AES_enc_blk (hm...)

I learned this half from being somewhat experienced with C and reading the decompiled code, and half from asking an LLM what certain confusing code snippets did.

On the beginning on the function there's a hardcoded 'master' key which its multiple derivations get SHA hashed 
[[../static/fortigate_sha_masterkey.png]]

Plus I found another binary blob that gets parsed by a "rsa_parse_pub_key" function, I labeled it 'likely rsa key' for this reason
[[../static/fortigate_likely_rsa_key.png]]

Then follows a complex part of the code which basically allocates kernel memory, decrypts a chunk of memory with ``chacha20_docrypt`` and does integrity verification by SHAing from ``__initrd_start``

**** The Interesting Part
[[../static/fortigate_the_interesting_part.png]]

This is the actual decryption routine!

To break it down what this does

'memory_alloc_pubkey', which got free'd and dereferenced earlier in the code so the name doesn't make sense anymore, is set to ``__initrd_start``, minus 100 bytes (presumably the signature is appended to the end and it is 100 bytes)

a function (likely something to do with aes) is called with ``sha_state`` and ``sha_iv`` (again, free'd/dereferenced)
A loop processes a block of local data (from local_88 up to the location of sha_key) by splitting each byte into its high and low nibbles (4-bit pieces) and XORing them together. This produces a nonzero checksum (bVar6), ensuring that if the computed value would be zero, itâ€™s forced to 1. This value is later used as an increment.

then it loops every 16 bytes and it calls aes_enc_blk and XORs it with ``memory_alloc_pubkey`` (if there are fewer than 16 it is processed similarly)

Knowing this, we have enough to write a decryption python script to decrypt rootfs.gz!
